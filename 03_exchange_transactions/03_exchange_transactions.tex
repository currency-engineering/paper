% \subsection{Markets}

% One effort to explain the sustained failure or markets to equilibriate at the aggregate level is to
% try to explain failure of equilibriation as a result of the way individual economic behaviour
% aggregates to failure or otherwise of markets for single products to equilibriate, and further to
% explain failure of markets to equilibriate at the aggregate level.
% 
% A fundamental method of science and engineering is to assume as a first step, is to use the mean
% value to aggregate a collection of micro-level behaviours. Often this turns out not to be correct,
% but invariably, in virtually every system we seek to explain, there are some parts of the system we
% explain away by averaging out noisy behaviour. 
% 
% If we use the same technique for understanding economic behaviour, we would, as a first step assume
% that we can average markets for single goods or services, result in an aggregate supply or demand
% close to zero.
% 
% If we use the same technique for understanding economic behaviour, we would, as a first step assume
% that we can aggregate our model of supply and demand for single goods or services, and arrive at a
% aggregate where aggregate supply or demand is close to zero.
% 
% Since this conclusion is contrary to facts, economists have directed their efforts at modifying the
% supply and demand model in many ways in an effort to explain this contradiction between fact and
% theory.
% 
% What is clear, however, is that the explanation has to be sufficiently fundamental to explain the
% remarkably consistent fact of excess aggregate supply and the rarity of aggregate market
% equilibrium. As put forward by Lucas, economists have yet to find a convincing understanding of
% this fact, let alone to find a solution to the problem of equilibrium failure or the problem of
% a sustained positive unemployment rate. 
% 
% Since our explanation of these facts is outside is not a part of the supply and demand model, we
% assume our simplest model of market behaviour, and that markets at the aggregate level do in fact
% equilibriate, relying on the law of large averages.

\subsection{An Exchange Transaction Only Model}

We will start with a model simplified from Figure \ref{fig:economic_feedback_schema1}. that includes only
exchange transactions.

\subsection{Price and Quantity}

Starting with exchange transactions

\end{figure}

we want to construct some aggregate variables. These aggregate variables could be sums, averages or
some other kind of measures of centrality. We'll categorize exchange transactions into different
``goods categories''. We'll use this term rather than say ``goods and services'' for brevity and
because it more closely reflects our requirements. We'll assume at this point that these goods
categories are sufficiently well-defined and precise as not to introduce too much noise into our
aggregate measures. For a given currency at a given period of time the transactions, we sum the
quantities for each goods category.

\[
    \left( q_1, \dots, q_N \right)
\]

and then let $pi$ be the average price of these transactions for a given good category. Let $N$ be
the total number of different goods categories. We'll denote the units for these values as

\[
    \left( \left[ q_1 \right], \dots, \left[ q_N \right] \right)
\]

We'll denote the average price for each $q_i$.

\[
    \left( p_1, \dots, p_N \right)
\]

The units for the average prices are 

\[
    \left( \left[ \frac {\$} {p_1} \right], \dots, \left[ \frac {\$} {p_N} \right]  \right)
\]

We cannot sum either these prices or quantities because they can have different units. But each
payment $p_i q_i$ can be summed because its unit, using dimensional analysis, is

\[
    \left[ \frac {\$} {q_i} \right] \left[ q_i \right] = \left[ \$ \right]
\]

So for a given time period, total payments for transactions for a currency is 

\[
    F = p_i q_i + \dots + p_N q_N
\]

We want to construct a aggregate measure of prices. As will become clear later in the paper we want
a measure $P$ that can be used to isolate purchasing power from the inflation rate. For example, if
a person has a certain amount of currency in their account at time $t=0$, and that they can buy a
certain amount with this currency, we want to know how much money they must have in their account at
time $t=1$ so that they can buy the same amount. As written, the notion of ``price level'',
``purchasing power'' and ``amount'' are vague and require mathematical treatment.

Suppose at a given time the transactions with quantites

\[
    \overline Q = \left( q_1, \dots, q_N \right) \textrm{ with corresponding prices } \left( p_1, \dots, p_N \right)
\]

occurs. We'll introduce Alice. We'll feed Alice a 1 dollar and Alice will spend this 1 dollar by
randomly selecting goods categories in such a way that in the limit they purchase quantities all in
proportion to total transactions. In other words,

\[
    \varepsilon_{q_1,\dots,q_n} = c_1 \overline Q
\]

where $c_1$ is a number between $0$ and $1$ and $\varepsilon_{q_1,\dots,q_n}$ is the expected value of
the ``abstract person'''s purchases. The $c_1$ represents the purchasing power of the Alice. It
represents the proportion of all transactions over which Alice has the power to purchase, per
dollar. While purchasing power is the amount of goods that will buy a given unit of currency, the
price level is its reciprocal, the amount of currency that will buy a unit of quantity.

We need to make things more precise, and to check that our measure of price can be used as an index
to isolate Alice's purchasing power from changes in the inflation rate. The motivate for this will
become clear later in the paper.

First we'll do a static analysis, and try to construct meaningful measures of aggregate price and
quantity for a time period that has 

\[
    \overline Q = \left( q_1, \dots, q_N \right) \textrm{ with corresponding prices } \left( p_1, \dots, p_N \right)
\]

Here, the vector $\overline Q$ represents a collection of values, but we want to construct a single
value that is a aggregate of these values. The problem is that each of these values may have
different units. We can construct units that such as ``one apple and two oranges''. The problem is
that if we do this it is impossible to express ``two apples and two oranges'' in these units. But if
we consider only a single period of time that has $\overline Q$ transactions, then we can express
this value in any unit of the form

\[
    \left( \left[ c q_1 \right], \dots \left[ c q_N \right] \right)
\]

for any number $c$. So in fact there is not just one, but a set of feasible units in which to
express $\overline Q$. We refer to any one of these set of units as a ``basket of goods''.














\subsection{Control of Price Level}

Before examining exchange transactions, we will briefly consider the feedback control mechanism.
Indexation is an important method for controlling distributed systems like a currency. An index is a
single value that is utilized by multiple components. An example of indexation in digital currencies
is Bitcoin's method for regulating the rate of production of blocks by Bitcoin miners. In this case
the indexation is algorithmic rather than controlled by a central authority. TODO

Another example of indexation is 

The simplest way to control the price level in a digital currency is to use indexation.





TODO

The feedback control loop does not work, however, in legacy currencies because the core currency
doesn't account for all money. Most money in legacy currencies is banking money, termed M1, M2 and
M3. Under these conditions, money authorities must use alternative methods to try and induce
financial institutions to increase the amount of banking money mainly through changing the interest
rate at which the money authority lends core currency to those financial institutions. At times this
method has been effective at controlling the price level, at other times less so. The process lacks
precision and has a long time-lag, making its use as the main mechanism for controlling economic
conditions problematic. Its effectiveness is also determined by financial institution's ability and
willingness to respond to decreases or increases in the monetary authority's core lending rate in a
way the maps to increases or decreases in aggregate demand.
