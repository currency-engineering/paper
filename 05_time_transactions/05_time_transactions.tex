\subsection{Interaction of Time Transactions and Exchange Transactions}

There is a positive feedback interaction between exchange transactions and time transactions that is
driven by increases in the inflation rate.

In his 1896 work \textit{Appreciation and Interest} Irving Fisher examines an adjustment that
economic participants must make to nominal interest rates if they are to maintain real interest
rates at a certain fixed rate, under inflationary conditions. We consider a simple example.





This is a process which in addition together with the effect of an error rate on market equilibrium
accounts for most of the effects of currency on market stability equilibrium and stability.
