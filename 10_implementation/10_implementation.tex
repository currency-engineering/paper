Using an open-source blockchain framework, and thereby leveraging the rapid technological advances
in the area of digital currency infrastructure is the only way to realistically build a digital
currency. Parity's open-source Substrate blockchain framework was used to build the Shannon digital
currency.

\subsubsection{Proof-of-stake Consensus}

Substrate's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism means that the unique, dynamic state on which the
distributed nodes reach agreement on is an abstraction of a state machine. A state machine is an
abstraction where functions are continuous sequentially applied to the the machine's state resulting
in a new, changed state. One of the implications of this is that it gives great flexibility as to
the choice of type of state.

Reduces energy consumption to very little.

\subsubsection{State Machine Abstraction}

Substrate's state also holds the code that defines the state machine, meaning that the state machine
transitions can be easily changed.

\subsubsection{Decentralization}

Additions Substrate is highly decentralized, meaning that a clear distinction between decentralized
and centralized function can be made.

\section{Isolation}

To a large extent, the underlying consensus infrastructure is isolated from the currency design. 

\section{Decentralization}

Substrate is a decentralized blockchain framework. Our initial build, however uses
proof-of-authority to control aspects of the blockchain.

1. upgrades

2. price level measurement and calculation

3. demand control

Parity connect improves decentralization.

\section{Transactions}

\section{Conservative Approach}

Limit time transactions to fixed schedule repayments. No contract transactions. No external
transactions.

\section{Data Collection and Price Level Calculation}

\section{Research and Upgrades}

Privacy

Price Measurements

Upgrade governance

Algorithmic control

\section{Scalability}
