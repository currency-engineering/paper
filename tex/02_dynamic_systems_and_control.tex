"Considering that any currency mechanism is absent from this model of sup-
ply and demand is seems reasonable to find a way to include currency in our
model. This leads to the question of what methods should be used to analyze
the properties of currency."

"The fundamental insight that we present is that because currency is a digital
system, the way to approach its analysis is roughly analogous to the way we
approach the analysis and design of other digital systems (the internet being an
interesting case in point), i.e. that we should approach the analysis of currency
as an engineering problem, and in particular the engineering and control of
dynamic systems."

In this chapter we introduce the engineering and control of dynamic systems.

\section{Negative Feedback}

We are looking for a way that we can keep the conditions of the system in some desirable state.
Examples are ... If the system is predictable can use an open system. Many systems, however are not
completely predictable. In many case, despite the unpredictability we can still control the system
to a certain degree. One method is to use a closed system. Another method is to introduce a
sophisticated controller into the loop, such as a human, in combination with the mechanism. Examples
are ...

A heater with a fixed output.

A heater with a thermostat.

Using a schema similar to \ref{fig:feedback_schema} we can represent the cyclist as,

\end{figure}

The 'reference signal' or 'set point' is the goal of the system, in this case most likely a
desination and when they want to arrive. The controller takes the set point and the present
conditions, i.e. where the cyclist is currently, the location of obstacles, if the road is heading
uphill or downhill etc.  weather conditions are, how much time they have remaining and convert this
into a control signal. Part of the control signal in this case is observable - the person's
adjustments to the handle-bars, other signals are not observable such as decisions on how hard to
pedal. The actuator in this case is the cyclists leg muscles, which convert those desicions, and use
energy to convert them into pedal pressure. The cyclist then observes the situation again and reacts
to the situation by feeding their sensory data back into the 'controller' and so on in a closed
loop. In the case of the cyclist we depend on continuous inputs in a changing, often unpredictable
environment to adjust behaviour - we require a closed loop system.

\section{History of Control Systems} 

\subsection{Huygens}

\subsection{Watt}

\subsection{James Clerk Maxwell}

\subsection{The Wright Brothers}

Prior to the Wright brother's first flight in December 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright believed that
the most fundamental problems they needed to solve were control problems. In September 1901 Wilbur
Wright's first public presentation on the feasibility of heavier-than-air flight stated that ``When
this one feature [control] has been worked out the age of flying machines will have arrived, for all
other difficulties are of minor importance."\cite{wright1908}

% TODO - this paragraph requires work.

The general view prior to the Wright brothers was that aircraft required the mechanism to
self-stabilize. [this was a problem because incorporating stability into the air-craft was at the
cost of agility. Possibly because the Wright brothers were bicycle-shop owners, and were aware that
bicycles are fundamentally unstable and require human intervention to stay upright, they understood
that this control could be done by the pilot rather than the plane.

\subsection{Elmer Sperry}

Rather than having a human do all the controlling, we are also interested in automating the control
system using a machine.
