Shannon currency is an open-source project that is hosted at https://currency.engineering.

We chose to use Parity Substrate blockchain library to implement Shannon. Due to Substrate's
modularity we were able to separate out the currency engineering functionality and the blockchain
infrastructure functionality into separate layers that interact with a clean interface.

The following figures show the user interface for various currency engineering functionality.
