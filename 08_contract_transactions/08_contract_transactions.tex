% \section{Mechanism}
% 
% \section{Negative Feedback}
% 
% There are two money transfers in a contract transaction. The first is a transfer of money in
% exchange for a good.
% 
% As with time transactions, interest rates are prices and are subject to excess supply/excess demand
% response. If a market has an equilibrium interest rate, an increase in that interest rate causes an
% excess supply as buyers reduce their purchases, putting pressure on the interest rate price in a
% negative direction. 
% 
% \section{Positive Feedback}
% 
% A positive feedback can occur if people believe that they can resell something at a later time with
% a higher price. This may increase demand rather than reduce it as in the negative feedback case.
% 
% Positive feedback is not possible for a single exchange transaction because it occurs at one point
% in time. There is only one payment. We'll look at the case of multiple exchange transactions in
% \ref{chapter:other_transactions}. Positive feedback is also not possible for a single time
% transactions, because at \(t_0\) a payment goes from lender to borrower (in exchange for a
% contractural obligation) while at \(t_1\) a repayment occurs from borrower to lender (in exchange
% for the release of the contract). These two transactions have a different nature. 
% 
% In the case of a contract transaction, a positive feedback is possible because it is possible to
% have multiple payments in a single transaction.

% \section{Proxy Accounts}
% 
% Contract transactions can be used to construct proxy accounts such as bank accounts, that are
% external to the accounts of the digital currency.

% \label{fig:mirror_proxy}
% \end{figure}
% 
% Figure \ref{fig:mirror_proxy}, Part A, shows a standard between a standard digitial currency. Part B
% shows the situation where account holders 1 and 2 have passed responsibility to the management of these
% accounts to a bank. The banks own accounts in the digital currenct, and present account holders 1
% and 2 with a dollar value written on a piece of paper or on a computer, written in the diagram as
% \verb|"\$"|. When a transaction is made by these two account holders, the bank mirrors this
% transaction in its digital currency accounts.
% 
% Part C shows the situation where bank 1 and bank 2 have many customers, and a single digital
% currency account that exactly mirrors the aggregate values in all the 'accounts' that the bank
% presents to the account holders. 
% 
% It might be possible (and in reality is generally possible) for banks to agree with each other to
% redeem transactions rather than at the exact time of a transaction but over a certain period of
% time, such as a day. If the behaviour of the transactions is random meaning that the aggregate flow
% of transactions from bank 1 to bank 2 cancel out the aggregate flow of transactions from bank 2 to
% bank 1 over that time period, then banks can use a ``fractional reserve system'' and reduce that
% holdings of digital accounts, without any change in the circumstances of the bank account holders.
% Under a fractional reserve system the flow of transactions through banking accounts can be an order
% of magnitude greater than through the core digital currency accounts.
% 
% This process requires that banks utilize contract transactions between the banks, so that payments
% are not settled exactly at the time of transaction, are repayed by the end of the period. Time
% transactions cannot be used as time transactions require a flow of goods between the two parties. So
% making part C more explicit, we have figure \ref{}.

% \section{Aggregate Demand Control}
% 
% Up until this point we have assumed that the digital currency can control aggregate demand through
% the feedback process shown in TODO. One way that aggregate demand can be controlled is through
% increasing the number of tokens that can be used for currency. This has involved finding additional
% sources of limited resources such as precious metals to supplement the currency, or by printing more
% money. Some digital currencies have copying the same method in a digital form, by controlling the
% supplementation of the existing currency with additional tokens. This is an indirect means of
% controlling the total amount of money in a currency.
% 
% Digital currencies, however, can be designed to directly control the total amount of currency
% through an index mechanism.  
% 
% \begin{figure}[H]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[scale=0.48]{08/payment_index}
% \caption{Payment Index Mechanism}
% \label{fig:payment_index}
% \end{figure}
% 
% The payment index is set by the monetary authority or by algorithm, and is globally accessible.
% Payment labelling and negotiation and agreements are done in dollars (\$). An account holds a base
% value, which remains constant when there are no transactions. The account holder however sees the
% dollar value of their account, which is constantly updated as the payment index changes. The dollar
% value of an account is the produce of the payment index and the base value. The account receiving a
% payment converts its value into a base value by dividing by the payment index and adding this value
% to the accounts current base value. Account holders are generally unaware of the base value, and
% observe a gradually changing dollar value, similar to the way a bank account appends interest
% payments. All the conversion between base value and dollar value is done automatically by the
% digital currency.
% 
% The monetary authority or algorithm increases or decreases the payment index in order to control
% aggregate excess supply or aggregate excess demand. In the presence of proxy accounts this control
% mechanism breaks down. Banking accounts become part of the set of all accounts that through market
% decisions made by account holders determine aggregate properties of the currency. Traditionally,
% monetary authorities try to control aggregate values by financial and banking regulations and
% through what are known are open-market operations, in which monetary authorities try to influence
% the degree to which banks have contractual obligations with each other by controlling the interest
% rate at which they can borrow the core digital account currency. This methods has at times been
% effective at controlling aggregate supply but at other times ineffective. In the absence of proxy
% accounts, control of the currency through a payment index is direct and likely to be timely,
% equitable and with high precision. Using this indexation, the tide rises all boats to exactly the
% same degree. Given that markets remain in equilibriation, the proportional increase in purchasing
% power is exactly equal to the proportional increase in the price level for every account holder.
% There is no lag between an increase in the payment index and increase in dollar value in accounts.

% \section{Interaction with Time Transactions}
% 
% Interest rates in traditional economies are highly correlated as a result of market activity. A
% rough working model is to think of an economy as having a single interest rate, qualified by
% ``risk''.  Both contract transactions and time transactions share this common interest rate. If the
% interest rate on contract transactions increases due to a positive feedback, at some point
% it will exceed the market interest rate for time transactions only, resulting in decreases in
% productive investment through time transactions while investment in a positive feedback bubble is
% occurring. The dynamics of these kinds of interactions are impossible to predict, both during a
% positive feedback event and subsequent to the positive feedback event when it is likely that a
% certain proportion of contracts from time and contract transactions default. In addition, contract
% transactions are unlimited in complexity of contractural arrangements. It is not possible to create
% control mechanisms to regulate instabilities that can occur as the result of the use of contract
% transactions.
% 
% \section{Interaction with Exchange Transactions}
% 
% To regulate exchnage transactions requires accurate regulation of aggregate demand so as to prevent
% unemployment and allow aggregate market equilibriation. To achieve our goal of a sustained and
% stable economy with market equilibriation, we must understand that our priority is to regulate
% exchange transactions in such a way as to reach this goal. The signification use of contract
% transactions results in the possibility of positive feedbacks that disturb time-transactions and
% degrade the effectiveness of control of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The large-scale use
% of contract transactions causes increases in the complexity of the system we want to control. If the
% use of currency as a means to transact contracts can be severely limited, we can also use a payment
% index mechanism for precise control over aggregate conditions.  We'll look at how this can be
% achieved in \ref{chapter:implementation}.
