\section{Other Transactions}
\label{section:other_transactions}

If the price a good or service can be resold at a higher price then another form of transaction is
possible. This transaction can induce a positive feedback loop as an increase in prices over time
cause other economic participants to enter the market, further increasing prices. Often part or all
of the motivation for buying land or precious metals is to transact in this way. One method to
prevent or limit this positive feedback instability is to use a separate currency for certain
classes of goods category, for example to use a specific currency to real-estate transactions. By
doing this it is possible to fix the exchange rate between the two currencies as an index that
tracks the average increases in prices of real-estate. Then a conversion between the two currencies
compensates for average changes in the price of this good.
